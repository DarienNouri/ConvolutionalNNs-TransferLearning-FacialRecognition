## Notebooks

- **01_Convolutional_NN_Architectures.ipynb**
  - Studies and compares different convolutional neural network architectures.
  - Includes parameter calculations, memory requirements, inception modules analysis, and Faster R-CNN.

- **02_TransferLearning_Shallow_vs_Finetuning.ipynb**
  - Explores transfer learning for image classification using a pre-trained ResNet50 model.
  - Compares fine-tuning the model and using it as a fixed feature extractor.

- **03_SiameseNetwork_Facial_Recognition.ipynb**
  - Trains a Siamese network for face recognition and evaluates its performance with different contrastive loss functions.
  - Examines robustness with and without glasses and compares Mining-Contrastive loss.
